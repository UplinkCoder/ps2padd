Yep finally the pre-release of PS2PADd appeared :D

PS2PADd allows you to exprot your Dualshock 2 via Network

so you won't need any USB-Adapter to use your Dualshock on your PC

just launch the ELF on your ps2 (for some reason it needs the Net started up by ulaunchelf before ....)
then install ppjoy (if not already done)
and start padclt.exe

the Virtual gamepad will be connected to your dualshock Hooray !
in the pre-release only the buttons exported 

nevertheless 

I would like you to give some feedback
and I would even more like improvments to my messy code :D

CU UC

BTW. the PKTDRV driver for SMAP (the PS2's ethernet adapter)
is written by Ps2DevMan not by me! Thanks for that!
Thanks also go out to the guy who wrote ppjoy !!
I also want to thank uebergeek42 for his ps2irc source.I borrowed loadmodules.h
and of course the whole PS2DEV people

finally ... Thank You for testing this stuff !
